# MentorMatching Smart Contract

## Overview

The `MentorMatching` smart contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that facilitates the matching of mentors and mentees based on shared interests. The contract allows users to register as either mentors or mentees and provides a mechanism to match them according to their interests.

## Features

- **Register as Mentor or Mentee**: Users can register themselves as either mentors or mentees, providing their name and areas of interest.
- **Interest-Based Matching**: The contract matches mentees with mentors based on shared interests.
- **View Registered Mentors and Mentees**: Users can view the list of all registered mentors and mentees.
- **Retrieve Matches**: The contract returns a list of matched mentor-mentee pairs.

## Contract Structure

### 1. **Mentor Structure**
```solidity
struct Mentor {
    string name;
    string[] interests;
}
```
- **name**: The name of the mentor.
- **interests**: An array of interests (e.g., Blockchain, AI) that the mentor is knowledgeable in.

### 2. **Mentee Structure**
```solidity
struct Mentee {
    string name;
    string[] interests;
}
```
- **name**: The name of the mentee.
- **interests**: An array of interests (e.g., Web Development, Data Science) that the mentee is interested in learning.

### 3. **Functions**

- **`addMentor(string memory _name, string[] memory _interests)`**: Adds a new mentor to the list.
- **`addMentee(string memory _name, string[] memory _interests)`**: Adds a new mentee to the list.
- **`getMentors() public view returns (Mentor[] memory)`**: Retrieves the list of all registered mentors.
- **`getMentees() public view returns (Mentee[] memory)`**: Retrieves the list of all registered mentees.
- **`matchMentorsAndMentees() public view returns (string[] memory)`**: Matches mentors and mentees based on shared interests and returns the list of matched pairs.

## Example Usage

### Registering a Mentor

```solidity
mentorMatching.addMentor("Alice", ["Blockchain", "AI"]);
```

### Registering a Mentee

```solidity
mentorMatching.addMentee("Bob", ["Blockchain", "Web Development"]);
```

### Matching Mentors and Mentees

```solidity
string[] memory matches = mentorMatching.matchMentorsAndMentees();
```

## Deployment

1. **Compile the Contract**: Use Hardhat or another Solidity compiler to compile the contract.
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network.
3. **Run the Script**: Interact with the contract using a script (e.g., `scripts/interact.js`) to register mentors and mentees and perform matching.
